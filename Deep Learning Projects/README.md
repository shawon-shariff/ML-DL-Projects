# Handwritten Digits Recognition using Artificial Neural Network(ANN)

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.


# We have achieved 98% accuracy of our ANN model on MNIST dataset.
